# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection

Driving while drowsy poses a significant risk to road safety. This Python project aims to create a Drowsiness Detection System that utilizes computer vision techniques to monitor a driver's facial features and provide timely alerts to prevent accidents caused by driver fatigue. The system captures images through a webcam, processes them using OpenCV for face and eye detection, and employs a Keras-based classification model to determine drowsiness. An alarm sound, implemented with Pygame, is triggered to alert the driver when signs of drowsiness are detected.

OpenCV – pip install opencv-python (face and eye detection).
TensorFlow – pip install tensorflow (keras uses TensorFlow as backend).
Keras – pip install keras (to build our classification model).
Pygame – pip install pygame (to play alarm sound)
